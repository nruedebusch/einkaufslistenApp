Shopping List App

This is a simple, user-friendly shopping list application developed using SvelteKit and Firebase. The application provides a seamless interface for users to manage their shopping lists.
Features

    Add Items to the List: Users can easily add items to their shopping list by entering the item name into an input field and clicking on the "Add to cart" button.

    View the List: The application displays the updated list of items on the screen, allowing users to see at a glance what items they need to buy.

    Remove Items from the List: Users can remove items from the list by simply clicking on the item in the list. This will instantly delete the item from the list and update the display.

    Real-time Data Syncing: The application leverages Firebase's real-time database feature, so changes made to the shopping list (such as adding or removing items) are synced in real-time across all instances of the application.

Technologies Used

This application is built using the following technologies:

    SvelteKit: SvelteKit is used for the front-end interface of the application. SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.

    Firebase: Firebase's real-time database is used for storing and syncing the shopping list data in real-time.

    TypeScript: TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, is used to ensure type safety and improve the developer experience.

    Vite: The application is bundled and served using Vite, which provides an extremely fast development server, and optimizes the build for production.

This shopping list application showcases how a simple interface, combined with real-time data syncing, can create a practical and efficient user experience. It serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to understand how to integrate SvelteKit with Firebase.
